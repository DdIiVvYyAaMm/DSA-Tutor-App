# Time Complexity

## What is Time Complexity?

Time complexity is a computational complexity measure that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It's a way to express how the running time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. Time complexity is usually denoted using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)), which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm, helping to classify and compare the efficiency of algorithms.

## Calculating Time Complexity for Binary Trees

To calculate the time complexity of a binary tree traversal algorithm, you need to analyze how many times each node in the tree is visited during the traversal process. The main traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder, and level order) involve visiting each node a fixed number of times.
