# Tree Operations

Traversal in binary trees is fundamental for performing various operations, as it defines a method to systematically visit each node in the tree. Different traversal methods can be used for operations such as insertion, deletion, search, finding the maximum/minimum value, etc.

## Common Traversal Methods:
- Inorder: (Left, Root, Right)
- Preorder: (Root, Left, Right)
- Postorder: (Left, Right, Root)
