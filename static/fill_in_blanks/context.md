# Binary Tree Basics

## What is a Binary Tree?

**Definition:** A Binary Tree Data Structure is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is commonly used in computer science for efficient storage and retrieval of data, with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Binary Tree Components
- Node: The basic unit of a tree containing data
- Edge: The link between parent and child nodes
- Root: The topmost node with no parent
- Leaf: A node with no children
- Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants
- Depth: The length of the path, or the number of edges, from the root to the node
- Max Depth: The length of the path, or the number of edges, from the root to the furthest leaf node
